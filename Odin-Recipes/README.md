Im using this project to do the basics of HTML
different things that I had learned throughout this portion
    <em> makes it italizsed 
    <strong> makes it bold
    <!-- makes a comment-->
    <ul> makes an unorded list
    <ol> makes an orderded list
    <li> use to make the list
    <img src="is used for the images" alt="to name it">
    <a href="to link to different things> 
        for an absolute link- you need the exact address- typically used for things outside of the folder
        for a link inside of the folder you can write the name of it
            for a link outside of the folder- need to step into the hall with ../

    <head> make sure to include it to name the website- <title>
    <p>for paragraph
    <body>- make the body within
    h1- header
    <body backgroun= image>
